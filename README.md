# Welcome!
~~_**Currently searching for a role as a junior blockchain security auditor!**_~~

I'm Kalzak, a CS/CybSec grad who has taken a huge interest in smart contract programming and security.<br>
Very passionate about security, I believe that blockchain has a place in the future and it needs to be secure in order for mass adoption. I hope to get started contributing in this amazing space as soon as I can (and now I am)!

Please message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kalzakdev) if you would like to get in contact with me!<br>
